## Logimeter Puzzle : 

We will give priority consideration to candidates supplying a pragmatic solution to the following puzzle:
 
A Census puts populations of 26 largest US metro areas at:
 
18897109, 12828837, 9661105, 6371773, 5965343, 5926800, 5582170, 5564635, 5268860, 4552402, 4335391, 4296250, 4224851, 4192887, 3439809, 3279933, 3095213, 2812896, 2783243, 2710489, 2543482, 2356285, 2226009, 2149127, 2142508, and 2134411.
 
Can you find a subset of these areas where a total of exactly 101000000 people live, assuming the census estimates are exactly right?
